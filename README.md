# hello-world
Not quite sure what this is just yet.

My name is Hannah. I am a teenager who is interested in picking up programming as a hobby and potential career. I am in the process of learning HTML & CSS, but would like to eventually move on to Java, JavaScript, IOs, C, C#, C++, and Python. Feel free to reach out to me, as I have no clue what I'm doing and would love some pointers!

Some non-code related tid-bits about me, I'm a Doctor Who fanatic, I avidly play video games when I'm not coding, working, or at school, and I know a thing or two about cars. I'm stubborn as a bull (which I've heard is really useful in this profession!), and I have a shorter attention span than a squirrel (which is maybe not so useful.).

Anyways, enough about me. Get outta here, and happy coding!
